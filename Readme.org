* About
This is the source branch for the web-presence of the entire Symengine project.
** Tutorial Contributions
To start working on tutorials, the following three-terminal workflow is recommended.
*** Setup
For the first terminal, we will instantiate a ~jupyter~ server.
#+begin_src bash
conda env create -f symedocs.yml
conda activate symedocs
jupyter lab
#+end_src

In another terminal, you can and should set up a file-watching task.

#+begin_src bash
bundle exec filewatcher "docs/Sphinx/source/**/*.{md,py}" "rake tut:mkDocs[html,nix]"
#+end_src

For the final terminal, we will spin up a server for the output.
#+begin_src bash
rake darkServe
#+end_src

In case you have cloned the repo for the first time, and are modifying an existing tutorial, note that the ~ipynb~ files need to be created.
#+begin_src bash
cd docs/tutorials
conda run "jupytext --to ipynb firststeps.md"
#+end_src
