# Site Rationale

```{tip}
You may be looking for a particular language's [API documentation instead](#api-documentation)
```

SymEngine is a fast symbolic manipulation library, written in C++. The core
focus of this site is to introduce the features of the library through practical
examples. The site is laid out in a largely linear fashion, with the tutorials preceding the discussion on integrating with build systems for production code.

To follow along, proceed to the [tutorial setup instructions](use/index).
